# Project_cryptography
We draw matrix which size we can change in code, base size 4x4, based on that matrix we encode 8-digits natural number into number in base of 95,
based on the drawn matrix we split aarraay of chars which we use to change base to 95, and we mix them, afterwards we encrypt number in base 95 once gaian, based on the mixed array.
While mixing, we save keys to decrypt the arraay.
Matrixes, drawn number, mixed array of chars, number in base 95 before and after encrypting are saved in text file among with keys to decrypt.

I put almost alal the informations in the text file, but we ofc can decide what should be in it.
